# personalAssistant

This version of the assistant uses computer audio as a input mic, and outputs its audio into the mic. This is so that you can put this in voice calls and it will talk to other devices. You can put it in a dsicord server and talk to it from anywhere from your phone. 

There is some set up needed to get this to work. You need two virtual audio cables, one directing the speaker to a output mic (so that when the assistant talks it goes through a mic), and another with a different speaker to an input mic (so that output from calls gets treated like mic input). Then set proper defaults and you're good to go.
